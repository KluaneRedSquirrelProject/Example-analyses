#Code for calculating activity and aggression scores
#Motivation: This code enables the user to calculate the activity and aggression scores from the personality file

#NA's for squirrels that are not from A. R. Martinig's study are NULL's (i.e. the observer did not record/enter in any info for that squirrel, hence observations are missing)

data<- data %>%
	mutate_all(funs(replace(., is.na(.), 1.0))) #makes all NA's 1.0 
	#this is required for juveniles from A. R. Martinig's study
	#these juveniles did not look at themselves in the mirror and based on A. R. Martinig's work, they need to be scored this way

#restrict the data to whichever age class and cohort you want to work with
#if you want to calculate scores for multiple age classes, make sure to make separate files for each age class
OFT<-data %>%

### script for running PCA on select columns from data set
###need to check that you use the right set of behaviours, and that they are formatted as was done previously
##e.g., proportion of time, counts, yes/no, etc.
OFT_j<-prcomp(OFT[c(17,18,19,20,21,22,23)], center=TRUE, scale =TRUE) #says which columns are from the OFT trial
summary(OFT_j) #gives loading for prinicpal components
OFT_j #shows how each behaviour is weighted

###script for adding PC1 column of OFT to data table
OFT$OFT1<-prcomp(~walk +jump+ hole + hang +chew +groom + still, data=OFT, center=TRUE, scale =TRUE)$x[,1]

#aggression trials
#NAs are given maximum value
MIS_max_j<-prcomp(OFT[c(24,25,26,27,28)], center=TRUE, scale =TRUE) #says which columns are from the MIS trial
summary(MIS_max_j) #gives loading for prinicpal components
MIS_max_j #shows how each behaviour is weighted

###script for adding PC1 column of MIS to data table
OFT$MIS1<-prcomp(~front + back + attack + attacklatency + approachlatency, data=OFT, center=TRUE, scale =TRUE)$x[,1]

#if you are interested in calculating the coefficient of variation (i.e., predictability), here is the code for this:
CV <- function(x){
        (sd(x)/mean(x))
}
